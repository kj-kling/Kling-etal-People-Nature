# CODE & OUTPUT #
Includes R code (R Markdown) & results output (pdf of R Markdown output) for models analyzing effects of (a) distance & nearest community population and (b) change over time on plot metrics.

The code & output also include model visualizations to assist with interpretation.

# PLOTS.CSV #
This is the dataset used in the R code provided. The sheet contains the following columns:

ID columns: plot.id, site, protected.area

Time columns: year (2015-2021) plots sampled, and time (years since 2015)

Population & Distance columns: pop (standardized population of community closest to plot; protected area plots given pop = 0), dist (standardized distance (m) to community closest to plot)

Plot metrics - Count columns (i.e., wood.ct): _n_ of individual trees of plants per plot for each provisioning service (timber, medicinal plant, and lemur food trees)

Plot metrics - Species Richness columns (i.e., wood.rich): _n_ of tree or plant species per plot for each provisioning service

# APPENDIX S1 #
Provisioning service(s) per plant:
This appendix contains information on the provisioning services of 408 locally-identified plant ethnonyms located on the Masoala Peninsula, northeastern Madagascar, as well as the abundance of these plants, by type, across botanical plots sampled in 2015-2016. The appendix contains the following tabs:

(1) Key: A key to the appendix' contents

(2) Plant Provisioning Services: A data table that indicates whether each plant is (a) used by local communities, and, if so, for what purpose(s); and (b) consumed by the red-ruffed lemur (Varecia rubra), and, if so, what plant part(s) are consumed (i.e., fruit, flowers, and/or leaves)

(3) Abundance (tab for each plant provisioning service): Data tables for each provisioning service (i.e., timber) that (a) document the abundance of each species of that service (i.e., each timber species) across all botanical plots included in the study that were surveyed 2015-2016, as % individuals of species/ total individuals of service (i.e., % n Spp X timber trees/ total N timber trees); and (b) classifies each species as of 'High,' 'Medium,' or 'Low' abundance for each provisioning service

(4) High Abundance: Data table that provides statistics on provisioning service overlaps for all species that were indicated to be 'High' abundance for any given provisioning service

_Plant provisioning services for humans were documented for eight purposes: (1) timber (i.e., wood), (2) medicinal plants, (3) food, (4) alcohol production, (5) cordage, (6) weaving, (7) fodder for livestock, and (8) "other" purposes (with description incl.)_
